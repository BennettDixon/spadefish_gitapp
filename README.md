# :fish: Spadefish :fish:

Spadefish is a web application that was developed in 24 hours by a team of seven engineering students at Holberton School. In this time we built a working frontend and backend, as well as deployed it to the cloud using a dockerized enviornment running on an Ubuntu VM.

Spadefish is a tool to create a graph based on your github activity. Using Github OAUTH we connect with your github and pull information regarding your language commit history. We then format this data into a graph for the user to see.
